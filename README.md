# cloudlabs

UCL provides access to AWS (Amazon Web Services) and Azure (Microsoft) via the  
[Public Cloud](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/isd/support-staff/cloud/public-cloud) services.

With this repository we want to provide help, concrete examples and advise on to create applications
in AWS (and possibly later, Azure).

# Examples, Design Patterns

- [Serverless app](./serverless-app/)
- [Docker swarm on EC2](./ec2-swarm/)
